# responsive_portfolio
    For this project I used bootstap,multiple html and css file to create a portfolio webstite. The home page is the h.html and styled using the h.css. on there you will find the navbar that links to the other htmls and footer which is where some contact info would be placed. if you click on the read more or the about me tab they will both send you to the about me page. on the about me page there is a navbar under that there is a row with the title of the page. then i split the rest of the page into 4 sections. the first one with a picture and the next one with some content about me. the third is where my hobbies would and the last one is for a list 0f skills i have.the portfolio page kind got turned into a gallery page for some photos ive taken but i didnt quit get the layout i was going for. And the contact page contains some social media links to my profiles.
